# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
```
###1.import numpy as np
###2.from scipy.linalg import lu,lu_factor,lu_piv
###3.Get input from the user as eval(input())
##4.Use lu_factor and lu_solve to find LU decomposition
print L,U
print x
```

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
```
